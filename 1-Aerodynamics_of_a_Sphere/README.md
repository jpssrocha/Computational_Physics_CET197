# Aerodynamics of a sphere

Project is divided into 2 components:

- sphere_aerodynamics.py -- Core of simulation
- viz.ipynb              -- Notebook with vizualization of results

# sphere_aerodynamics.py

Module containing implementation the core of the simulation

## Version 0

Idealized case. Simple projectile motion using analytical solution compared to
the solution via Euler's method.

## Version 1

Case with stokes drag solved through Euler's method compared to the analytical
solution of the idealized case.

## Version 2

General case with drag coefficient calculated through a relationship obtained
via empirical data (Morrison, 2016), and the Magnus force as defined on Aguiar
& Rubini 2004.

# viz.ipynb

Notebook with the vizualization generated by running the main simulation with
different parameters.
